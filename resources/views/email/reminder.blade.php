<!-- <p>Hello, {{$name}}</p> -->
<p>We are happy to have you joining us on our big day</p>
<p>As a helpful reminder, we will be sending out one or two emails as the day approaches. Don't worry, you won't be spammed...though we're sure we can work something out if you want us to.</p>
<p>Should you ever have to update your information, like your dietary restrictions or attendance, just go to <a href="http://www.samandsarah2018.com">samuandsarah2018.com</a> and RSVP again. Your new data will overwrite your previous RSVP.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you!</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Samuel and Sarah</p>

    <p>We knew of each other a year before we first met. That‚Äôs right, it took a whole year before we would even speak to one another! It all started at an IVCF (a Christian club on campus) party that we both attended. Sam's friends, Joshua and Jordyn, had met her and instantly saw the chemistry that could be. Don‚Äôt ask us how, they just did! After the party, they sat Sam down and told him of Sarah and how she matched his wavelength. Sam shrugged it off at the time and that was that.</p>
    <p>Our fates clashed again at a week long camp retreat. Like our previous "encounter", we never talked. Take a look at this picture to see just how close we got without even interacting with each other.</p>

    <p>Finally, a few months later, we became bible study co-leaders. That‚Äôs when Sarah said her first words to Sam.</p>

    <p>From "being around but never interacting", we quickly became ingrained into each other's lives as we led Bible studies together and sparred on Saturday mornings. Our lives mixed like gravy and mashed potatoes.</p>
    <p>Samuel quickly grew feelings for Sarah and had concluded that Sarah felt the same way; in his opinion, the signs were too many. When he first approached her about this, she grew quiet and rejected him with a quiet mumble, "umm, this is awkward". The stars were apparantly not aligned.</p>
    <p>Despite the awkward encounter, our friendship continued to grow deeper, inducing Samuel to approah Sarah yet again. This time, Samuel explained how he saw this going two ways. One, she liked him but there were things going in her life that prevented her from being in a relationship. Two, she really did not have any interest in a romantic relationship and therefore, he really should forget about all of this.</p>
    <p>You probably won‚Äôt be able to guess what she said. Ready for it?</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>‚ÄúI guess I could like you if I forced myself to.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Sarah, reluctant to turn Sam down again, had tried to express it more elegantly than last time. Needless to say, Sarah eventually began to reciprocate the feelings a month later and after a couple more months of careful thought, she decided to tell Sam.</p>
    <p>Our relationship has more or less followed the same template: Samuel has always been eager to move to the next stage (sometimes impatiently) while Sarah has been cautious (sometimes reluctant). The exception to this occurred in August of 2017 when Sarah decided she was ready for marriage. Samuel had been waiting for her to give him the go on getting a ring, but she had other plans in mind. She waited until we took a trip to BC on a YMCA youth exchange program with our church. On top of Sunny Peaks mountain, Sarah proposed.</p>
    <p>So here we are now, with engagement watches, getting ready for a wedding and we want you to be a part of it üôÇ</p>
